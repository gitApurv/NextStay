> NextStay is a modern, Airbnb-inspired web application that enables users to list, discover, and manage rental properties with ease. Users can create and publish their own property listings, complete with images and details, and make them available to others searching for accommodations. A built-in search bar allows for quick filtering and discovery of listings based on user preferences.

### 🏠 [Homepage](Visitors can bookmark their favorite properties, share listings with others, and directly message property listers. When a message is sent, the lister receives both the message content and the sender’s contact details, enabling easy communication. Each user has access to a personalized profile page where they can view all their listed properties, as well as edit or delete them at any time.)
